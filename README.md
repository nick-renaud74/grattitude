# grattitude
Personal productivity app that helps users build a daily gratitude practice by temporarily restricting access to other apps during a  user-defined time window (e.g., 6-9am) until they write 3 gratitude entries. 

Grattitude - Daily Habit Builder
I'm currently developing Grattitude, a React Native app that helps people build positive daily habits through gratitude practice. The app uses iOS Screen Time APIs and Android accessibility features to create intentional moments of reflection in our busy digital lives.
